# MyTeam

## Introduction

This project was made with sketches by the frontendmentor.io website.
It's a 3 pages website of an imaginary company, fully responsive with a form made with Formik and Yup libraries.
The css part is managed by scss files (mainly for nesting). This project goal was to train myself with design websites and handle responsive layouts, therefore I used mobile first approach.

The technologies I implemented in this project: React, JSX, Reach Router, Formik, Yup, CSS Grid/Flexbox, Sass.
